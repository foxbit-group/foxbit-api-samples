This directory contains JavaScript examples demonstrating how to interact with the Foxbit API REST v3 using the official Foxbit SDK. These scripts cover a range of functionalities, from fetching market data to placing orders and managing your account, now leveraging the SDK for easier integration and improved reliability.
